You may have heard of Aztec! If not, please feel free to check it our anytime [here](https://www.aztec.bio). This repository is for a tiny tiny component for the huge huge Greatest Project Ever -- Aztec.

It downloads the medical-related vocabularies from [here](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/MESH/?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.bioontology.org%2Fontology%2FMESH%2FD000602). As you can see, the hierarchical menu at the left side contents hundreds of words. Applying these words as the rectification of a certain keywork extraction would enhance the accuracy.

Good luck.
